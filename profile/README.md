# Commit Check

**Commit Check** is a free, powerful tool that enforces commit metadata standards, including commit message, branch naming, committer name/email, and commit signoff. Fully customizable with error messages and suggested commands, it ensures compliance across teams.

As an alternative to GitHub Enerprise [Metadata restrictions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.11/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/available-rules-for-rulesets#metadata-restrictions) and Bitbucket's paid puglin [Yet Another Commit Checker](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211854/yet-another-commit-checker?tab=overview&hosting=datacenter), Commit Check stands out by integrating DevOps principles and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

**Wonder how to get started? check out**:
* [commit-check](https://github.com/commit-check/commit-check) running as CLI or pre-commit hook.
* [commit-check-action](https://github.com/commit-check/commit-check-action) running as GitHub Action.
